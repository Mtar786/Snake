# Snake Game

The Snake Game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around a grid. The objective of the game is to eat food items that appear randomly on the grid, which causes the snake to grow in length. The game continues until the snake collides with itself or hits the boundaries of the grid.

## How to Play

1. Controls:
   - Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake's direction.
   - Alternatively, you can use the WASD keys (W for Up, A for Left, S for Down, D for Right).

2. Game Rules:
   - The snake starts with a length of one and moves in the direction set by the player.
   - The snake continuously moves forward at a fixed speed.
   - The player's objective is to guide the snake to eat the food items that appear on the grid.
   - Each time the snake eats a food item, its length increases by one.
   - The game ends if the snake collides with itself or hits the boundaries of the grid.
   - The score is determined by the number of food items the snake has eaten.

3. Game Features:
   - The game may have different levels of difficulty, such as increasing the speed of the snake or adding obstacles on the grid.
   - The player's score and the highest score achieved can be displayed on the screen.
   - Sound effects and visual cues can be incorporated to enhance the gaming experience.
